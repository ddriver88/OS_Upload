Can you please write me a Python script that does the following:
- Use streamlit module
- Allow upload of either CSV or XSLX
- Show a preview of the uploaded file
- Allow user to specify the name of the output file
- Column A is "Location Name" 
- Allow User to provide a Location Name and populate it in every row that contains data
- Column B is "First Name"
- Column C is "Last Name"
- Column D is "Email"
- Column H is "Postal Code"
- Column I is "Home Phone"
- Column J is "Mobile Phone"
- Column K is "Work Phone"
- verify that columns B and C are not blank. If they are, delete the row.
- verify that column D is a valid email format using regex
- verify that column I is a valid phone number format using regex
- verify that column J is a valid phone number format using regex
- verify that column K is a valid phone number format using regex
- If columns I, J, and K are not valid phone number formats delete the invalid data from the cell
- If columns D, I, J, and K are all blank, delete the row
- Ultimately this script should remove any invalid data in the specified cells while retaining data that is valid
- Contain a Download button that will allow the user to download the processed file strictly in .xlsx format only
