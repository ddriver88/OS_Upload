### There are three main files:
- CSV-to-CSV.py
- CSV-to-XLSX.py
- COS_LeadUploadFormatter_UI.py

The first two can only be run via the Command Line Interface (CLI) and may not be the best option. The first especially as the admin app does not accept CSV format for lead uploads.

**I would recommend using COS_LeadUploadFormatter_UI.py exclusively.**

## To Use COS_LeadUploadFormatter_UI.py
